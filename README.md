### Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5
**Create a Set of Radio Buttons**
- I didn't know there was an easy way of making a setup like this for questions with single answers. it is also good to know that it is common practice to use a for attribute in the label with a value equal to the input id. I'm not familiar with assistive technologies or how they work work but knowing best practive for them seems likely to be useful.
### Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5
**Create a Set of Checkboxes**
- I am a little confused as to why these inputs need to be wrapped in a label element and if they would loose some functionality if they weren't?Is that just common practice in order for it to look nicely formatted?
### Basic CSS
**Use an id Attribute to Style an Element**
- I did not realize that ids were more specific than classes and therefore override the styles of the class if both are applied. I can see where this would be helpful when you want two items in the same class to have mostly the same styles but one slightly different and also where this can cause problems if you don't realize where the style is coming from. 
### Basic CSS
**Use CSS Variables to change several elements at once**
- The variables are very cool functionality that I didn't know about. I feel like above all it makes the code cleaner to look at so when you see what color the element is it's not just gray, it penguin-skin which gives you more information about what the element is and what it's doing. It also seems you can use this for more than just colors which is really cool. 
### CSS Flexbox
**Align Elements Using the align-items Property**
- This makes everything make so much more sense! I've used flexboxes and couldn't find a consistent way to center items inside of them but that is because I was using some rows and some columns and now I get the actual difference between justify content and align-items.
